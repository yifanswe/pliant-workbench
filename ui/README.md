# UI

**Responsibility:** define the declarative UI package boundary, validation,
state bindings, interactions, and native rendering.

**Boundary:** UI code uses public operations and observable state. It cannot
access Chromium, protected profile data, credentials, or core implementation details.
The broader DSL syntax, host language, and native UI framework remain open.

**Scope:** the editor version 1 reuses the VS Code core; how its UI relates to
this boundary is open ([ADR 0002](../docs/decisions/0002-editor-browser-agent-scope.md)).

**Status:** [`definition/`](definition/) implements the bounded JSON definition,
validation, preview/apply/reject/reset state machine, and address-open policy
used by the native customization demo. The AppKit renderer remains app-local;
there is no general UI runtime or plugin-facing UI API yet. See the
[module map](../MODULES.md).
